# CPU-Scheduling
This project is to implement basic CPU scheduling techniques in different languages in the most efficient way possible in that language.
Every changes over time will be mentioned in **log.md** with the name of one who made it.

**Introduction**<br/>
Four techniques of CPU Scheduling will be done :
1.FCFJ
2.SCJ
3.Priority
4.Round-Robin

**Initial approach**<br/>
First user enters the number of processes and the Burst time (time taken by each process) of every process.
After user enters burst time of all the processes, a menu is displayed on the screen giving user the choice for performing the the four types of scheduling techniques. After which the user enters the requisite data according to the choice entered.
<ul>
<li>For FCFJ, no additional data needed from user</li>
<li>For SCJ, no additional data needed from user</li>
<li>For Priority, Priorities is needed for each process from user</li>
<li>For Round-Robin, quantum is taken as input from user</li>
</ul>
